        <hr/>
        <p>Hello World my name is Jose. I am studying CIS at Chaffey Community College.
            I can't wait to be done with my A.A. which hopefully will be at the end of this year.
            Hopefully that will open the doors for me to get a decent computer tech job.
        </p>
